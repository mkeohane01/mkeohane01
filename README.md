Hello to whomever is reasing my GitHub! I am Mike Keohane, a Duke student studying Electrical and Computer Enginnering (ECE) and Computer Science.
I am on the machine learning track, but I have just started taking the introduction classes for it. This GitHub contains work I did in classes throughout
my time at Duke. The code written has been created through my classes either from templates or a clear instruction document given to me. The work I did in CS201 
Data Structures and algorithms can be found at the GitLab from that course: https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/michael.keohane
